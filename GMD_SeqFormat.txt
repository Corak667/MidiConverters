Sequence Commands
-----------------
Note Mode 0: (commonly used on MIDI melody channels)
  00..7F dd ll - Note, delay dd, length ll
	Note: Notes can be extended by replaying them at tick ll.
	      i.e. "note extension" is processed *before* a note expires
	     TODO: verify exact note expiration tick
Note Mode 1: (commonly used on MIDI drum channels)
  00..7F dd vv - Note, delay dd, velocity vv
	Note: Notes are stopped when being replayed.
	vv = 00..7F: play note with velocity vv
	vv = 80..FF: play note with velocity [channel velocity + vv] where (vv & 0x7F) is a signed two's complement 7-bit value
Note Mode 2: (commonly used on FM/SSG channels)
  00..7F dd - Note, length/delay dd
	Note: Command EF is used for extending notes.
	In all other cases, the actual note length "nl" [TrkRAM+1B] is calculated as follows:
		nlm == 00h: nl = dd
		nlm == 10h: nl = dd - nls
		else: nl = dd * nlm / 10h
Note Mode 3:
  00..7F dd ll vv - Note, delay dd, length ll, velocity vv
	vv works the same as in Note Mode 1.
80 ll - rest, length ll [Note Mode 0/1/2]
80 ll cc - rest, length ll [Note Mode 3]
	cc = 0 -> do nothing else
	cc > 0 -> force all playing notes to play cc ticks
81 ll - delay, length ll
82 [nn nn ...] - Note Off
	A series of notes to be turned off. The last nn has bit 7 set.
83 [nn vv nn vv ...] - Note On
	A series of notes to be played. Note nn, velocity vv. The last nn has bit 7 set.
84 vv - Note Length Multiplicator "nlm" (only has effect in Note Mode 2)
85 vv - Note Length Subtraction "nls" (only has effect in Note Mode 2)
86 ll mm - set Track Detune (mm = MSB, ll = LSB, 8.8 fixed point, 0000 = center)
87 ll mm - add mmll to Track Detune
88 tt - set track transposition to tt
89 tt - add tt to track transposition
8A - reset Pitch Bend
8B ll mm - set Pitch Bend (mm = MSB, ll = LSB, 0000 = min, 2000 = center, 3FFF = max)
8C ll mm - add mmll to Pitch Bend
8D aa bb - Portamento Up?
8E aa bb - Portamento Down?
8F pp - Sustain Pedal (MIDI CC 64), value pp
90 vv - Channel Volume (MIDI CC 7), value vv
91 vv - Channel Volume Accumulate
	Step 1:
		vv = 00/80: reuse saved Channel Volume Accumulator cva
		vv = 01..7F, 81..FF: save "vv & 0x7F" to Channel Volume Accumulator cva
	Step 2:
		vv = 00..7F: add cva to channel volume
		vv = 80..FF: subtract cva from channel volume
92 vv - set Note Velocity, value vv
93 vv - Note Velocity Accumulate, see command 91
95 vv - ??
96 vv - ??
97 aa bb cc - ??
98 ll mm - set Song Tempo in BPM (value mmll, clamped to 300)
9A ss ii - Tempo Modifier
	ss = tempo scale (0x20 = 50%, 0x40 = 100%, 0x80 = 200%)
	ii = interpolation?
9C ii - silence channel, then set Instrument ii
	Silencing is done by:
		- sending Sustain Pedal Off (controller 64, data 0)
		- [Note Mode 0/2/3] turning all notes off explicitly
		- [Note Mode 0/2/3] sending All Notes Off (controller 123, data 0)
9D bb ii - set Bank MSB bb, Instrument ii
9E nn vv - Note Aftertouch, note nn, value vv
9F vv - Channel Aftertouch, value vv
A0 ii - Pan via LUT (00 = centre, 01 = left, 02 = right, 03 = centre, 04..FF = invalid)
A1 pp - Pan (MIDI CC 10), value pp
A2 pp - add pp to Pan
	pp == 00..7F: pan = (pan + (pp & 7F))
	pp == 80..FF: pan = (pan - (pp & 7F))
	The result is clamped into [01..7F].
A4 mm [dd] - MIDI Modulation (MIDI CC 1), strength mm
	mm = 00..7F: just set modulation strength = mm, parameter dd is missing
	mm = 80..FF: set modulation strength = (mm & 0x7F), set modulation delay = dd ticks
A5 ee [dd] - Software Modulation Enable (bb exists only when aa = 80..FF)
	ee == 00: disable
	ee == 01..7F: enable
	When (ee & 80), then an additional byte for Modulation Delay dd is present
A7 mm t1 t2 d1 d2 - Software Modulation Parameters
	mm: Modulation Mode (00..03)
	t2t1: ticks until the frequency delta is inversed
	d2d1: initial frequency delta
AC rr dd - OPNA register write
	Notes:
		- channel mode 0/1/6 only
		- always goes to port 0
AD rr dd - OPNA channel register write, register rr, data dd
	Notes:
		- channel mode 0/6 only
		- only useable with rr = 30h..B6h, ignored else
		- port/register ID are modified in order to access the current channel
AE cc dd - MIDI Controller cc, data dd
AF [dd dd ...] - send SysEx command
	F0 dd dd ... F7
	Note: The last data byte (dd) has Bit 7 (80) set.
B0 vv - set RPN Pitch Bend Range to vv
	sends RPN MSB 0, RPN LSB 0, Data MSB vv
B1 mm ll vv - set RPN MSB mm, LSB ll, Data MSB vv
B3 mm ll vv - set NRPN MSB mm, LSB ll, Data MSB vv
B5 di mi - set SysEx command header (di = device ID, mi = model ID)
B6 a1 a2 a3 [dd dd ...] - send Roland SysEx command
	F0 41 di mi 12 a1 a2 a3 dd dd .. [chksum] F7
	Note: The last data byte (dd) has Bit 7 (80) set.
B7 - set Roland GS Reset
	F0 41 10 42 40 00 7F 41 F7
B8 vv - Expression (MIDI CC 11), value vv
E0 mm cc - set channel mode/ID
	mm = 00 (FM): cc = 00..05 (FM 1..6)
	mm = 01 (SSG): cc = 00..02 (SSG 1..3)
	mm = 06
	mm = 07 (OPNA Rhythm)
	mm = 10 (MIDI): cc = 00..0F (MIDI channel 1..16)
E1 mm - set note mode
E2 vv - ??
E3 vv - ??
E5 ll mm - repeat measure at mmll (mmll is relative to the track header)
	Notes:
		- The E5 command may jump to another E5 directly, which is followed.
		- Nesting is not allowed and results in the driver leaving the repeated measure.
	Examples:
		E5 1111 -> E5 2222 -> E5 3333 -> [data]: will repeat the measure at offset 3333
		E5 1111 -> [data] E5 2222 -> will play [data], but returns at "E5 2222"
E6 tt - Loop Start (loop tt times, 00 = infinite)
E7 - Loop End
E8 - Loop Start
E9 tt - Loop End (loop tt times, 00 = infinite)
EA ll mm - Loop Exit (jump to offset mmll when remaining loops == 1, mmll is relative to byte after mm)
EB tt ll mm - special loop jump (TODO: how does this work exactly?)
EC ll mm - jump to offset mmll (mmll is relative to byte after mm)
ED vv - ?? (some special loop stuff?)
	OPN/OPNA songs often use vv=00 for Master Loop Start and vv=01 for Master Loop End
EE - no effect
EF - note tie (MUST be the byte after the note command to have an effect, checked via look-ahead, Note Mode 2 only)
F7 aa bb cc - set Fade Out parameters
	Note: invalid in CSCP.BIN (valkyrie_98), valid in SSCP.BIN and present in most songs that use this
 driver
	aa: number of ticks before fading starts
	bb: delay between fade steps (decremented every 4 ticks until 1 is reached)
	cc: fade duration in ticks
F8 vv - set Marker to vv
F9 vv - add vv to Marker
FA ll mm  - Measure End: set Measure ID to mmll, may return from Repeated Measure
FB - Measure End: increment Measure ID, may return from Repeated Measure
FC [...] 00 - comment? (the driver skips until it finds a 00 byte)
FD - no effect
FE xx - ??
FF - Track End
